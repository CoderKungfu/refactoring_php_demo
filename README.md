# Refactoring Like a Pro

## What is refactoring?

- A change made to the internal structure of software to make it:
	-  Easier to understand.
	-  Cheaper to make future changes.
- This does not change the observable behavior of the software.
- Tests help ensure that we didn't change behavior.

## Why do we refactor?

- Software left alone will decay.
- Makes it cheaper to make changes.
- Make it easier to understand.
- Improves the design of the code.

## Refactoring techniques:

1. [Change names to communicate intent](examples/technique1.md)
2. [No magic numbers / variables](examples/technique2.md)
3. [One responsibility per function / class](examples/technique3.md)
4. [Do not be obsessed with primitives](examples/technique4.md)
